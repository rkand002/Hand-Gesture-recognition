%% MyoMex Quickstart
% Before you begin, please read through README.txt and follow all steps
% for setting up the Myo Connect application, Myo SDK, and building the
% MEX function |myo_mex|.

%% Before Using |MyoMex|
% If you decided not to read through |README.txt|, let's at least show you
% the quickest possible way to get started.

install_myo_mex; % adds directories to MATLAB search path
% install_myo_mex save % additionally saves the path

sdk_path = 'C:\myo-sdk-win-0.9.0'; % root path to Myo SDK
build_myo_mex(sdk_path); % builds myo_mex

%% MyoMex Usage
% Before using |MyoMex|, you must decide how many Myos would like to use in
% this session. The MyoMex constructor argument |countMyos| specifies this
% value. Make sure that exactly |countMyos| devices are connected in the
% Myo Connect application or else MyoMex construction will fail. The Myo
% device(s) should also be worn on a human arm to avoid unexpected
% disconnection of the device from Myo Connect. If Myo Connect loses a
% device at any time, MyoMex will terminate and invalidate itself.

countMyos = 1;

%% Instantiate MyoMex
% After constructing a new |MyoMex| instance, we'll inspect its properties.

mm = MyoMex(countMyos)

%%
% Notice that the only property of |mm| is a |1xcountMyos| MyoData object.
% There is no device data stored by |mm|. The data from each physical Myo
% device is passed through |mm| to each element of |mm.myoData|.

%% Inspect |MyoData|
% Since |MyoData| objects inherit from |handle|, we can get handles to the
% |MyoData| objects representing each physical device and use them
% directly.

m1 = mm.myoData(1);
if countMyos == 2, m2 = mm.myoData(2); end

%%
% Now, we'll just continue this exercise with |m1|, but the exact same
% demonstration applies for |m2| as well (if |countMyos == 2|.
%
% The most recent data from Myo will be stored in the relevant properties
% of the |MyoData| object (i.e. |quat|, |gyro|, |accel|, |emg|, |pose|,
% etc.). The following is a list of all properties in |MyoData|.

pause(0.1); % wait briefly for the first data frame to come in

% data properties sampled on the EMG time base

%% Using Logged Data
% As |MyoData| receives data from |MyoMex|, it's automatically accumulated
% in so-called |<data>_log| properties, i.e. |quat_log|, |accel_log|, etc.
% We refer to this as the streaming mode of a |MyoData| object. This status
% is indicated by the |isStreaming| property.

m1.isStreaming

%%
% We can inspect the accumulation of the logs for example,

fprintf('%10s%10s\n','time','samples')
for ii = 1:5
  fprintf('% 8.2f%10d\n',...
    m1.timeIMU,size(m1.quat_log,1));
  pause(0.2);
end
fprintf('\n\n');

%%
% Although we can't stop the data from being passed to in |MyoData|, we can
% toggle streaming mode by using the methods |stopStreaming()| and
% |startStreaming()|.

m1.stopStreaming();
fprintf('Number of samples:               \t%d\n',length(m1.timeIMU_log));
pause(1);
fprintf('Number of samples after pause(1):\t%d\n',length(m1.timeIMU_log));

%%
% Now we can plot some data taking care to use the correct time vectors.

figure;
subplot(3,1,1); plot(m1.timeIMU_log,m1.gyro_log);  title('gyro');
subplot(3,1,2); plot(m1.timeIMU_log,m1.accel_log); title('accel');
subplot(3,1,3); plot(m1.timeEMG_log,m1.emg_log);   title('emg');

%%
% If you'd like to clear the |<data>_log| properties to start a new logging
% trial, then you may use the |clearLogs()| method,

% collect about T seconds of data
T = 5; % seconds
m1.clearLogs()
m1.startStreaming();
pause(T);
m1.stopStreaming();
fprintf('Logged data for %d seconds,\n\t',T);
fprintf('IMU samples: %10d\tApprox. IMU sample rate: %5.2f\n\t',...
  length(m1.timeIMU_log),length(m1.timeIMU_log)/T);
fprintf('EMG samples: %10d\tApprox. EMG sample rate: %5.2f\n\t',...
  length(m1.timeEMG_log),length(m1.timeEMG_log)/T);

%%
% Finally, when you're done with |MyoMex|, don't forget to clean up!

mm.delete;
clear mm
